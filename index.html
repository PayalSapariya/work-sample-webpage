                <li><strong>Split-Expense Feature:</strong> A new feature was added based on student feedback, allowing shared expenses to be easily divided.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Accessibility:</strong> High-contrast colors and better navigation were implemented to enhance usability for all users.</li>
            </ul>
